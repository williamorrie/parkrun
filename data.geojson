          "description": "Ashton Court parkrun is a simple out and back course, starting and finishing on the main service road 250m beyond the mansion, and following well made paths to a turning point close to the Ashton Court quarry. The first and last 1.3km is run on a tarmac service road (closed to motor traffic, except authorised park vehicles). The middle 2.4 km is on a wide stone/gravel path, generally well drained although the top of the course is subject to potholes resulting in puddles after heavy rain. From the start to the turning point there is an ascent of around 100m. This is mostly a steady climb, although two short stretches are quite steep. Nobody should be put off by this. There is no shame in walking the steep bits - they\u2019re always followed by some respite and at the turning point you\u2019re rewarded with fantastic views over Bristol and the surrounding countryside, and the promise of 2.5km downhill to the finish. The course will be signposted and, subject to available volunteers, there will be marshals midway and at the turning point. As it\u2019s open to both sides, it\u2019s easy to avoid or give way to other park users. However, particular care should be taken to avoid cyclists who sometimes travel at speed on these paths. If you have any questions on the day, any of the volunteers will be happy to help. They\u2019re normally identifiable by their hi-viz jackets. At the end of the run, please take your barcode and position token to the registration to record your details. This will either be by the finish point or in the mansion courtyard.",

At the bottom, turn left onto tarmac path following the path around the lake, passing the playground and the Caf\u00e9 to the end of the path, then turning left to repeat for the second and third lap. At the end of the third lap the course finishes by the Caf\u00e9.",

As you approach a righthand turn there is a post in the middle of the path to avoid, followed by the surface becoming slightly uneven, then you will be running with the marina on your left on a gravel path, which can be muddy after wet weather. Before the bollards take the gravel path which forks to the right up a slight slope into the country park where you will be on grass. Follow the signs and do a clock wise loop where a marshal will guide you back down a grassy path almost returning to the gravel path. Follow the sign to continue along the edge of the field guided by flags until you reach a lefthand corner and continue east until you run through a picnic area and fork right down a gravel path to the quay for a few metres where a sign will ask you to keep left as you run in the contraflow section. Then fork left by the beacon and follow a stony path down a quite steep slope to the car park but at the bottom do a sharp right turn back on to a gravel path and keeping the skate park on your left run until the sign tells you to turn right back to the start and run another lap and the finish funnel will be next to the Start.",

Continue until you come to the footbridge, cross over the bridge and continue along this path which runs parallel with the Monaghan Road. Keep right on the path, then continue straight across Dartry avenue where you do a 'U' loop and come back along the forest path and return across the footbridge and back to the start area. At this point, 2.5km are complete so you do the full loop a second time to complete the 5km route. You will be treated to beautiful broadleaf forest trails, stunning river views in a wonderful family friendly outdoor amenity setting. This route is the only parkrun route which crosses between two County boundaries! When you cross the footbridge and the Dromore River you are leaving County Cavan and entering County Monaghan!",

The first lap runs anticlockwise around White Swan Lake, taking in Tufty\u2019s Corner, and the second lap runs around the west side of Black Swan Lake until the path to the bird hide, which you take around Herons Water until the top of White Swan Lake, which you then follow around (bypassing Tufty\u2019s Corner) until the start. The footpath is mostly compacted gravel and very flat and in dry weather regular road running shoes will suffice. If it has been raining recently the paths will have puddles and areas of the course can get muddy and potentially slippery so, if you have them, trail shoes would be better.",

Then it's a left turn, following the path east past the pavilion and playground on the left, and continuing along the path to the far corner of the next field. The course then turns left going a slight upslope to the top of the field near a large gate. At the gate turn right across a small grass patch to the miniature railway crossing, then follow the path around to the right at the crossing. Follow the winding path through the wooded area, initially going left following a miniature railway fenceline, until it finally comes to the dog walking field. Follow the path across the dog walking field and through another wooded area with the train line on the right.

This is a downhill section, keep going over the canal bridge then turn left just after the pig pen. You are now back onto woodland paths that can get muddy, but it is beautiful and fun. As you come out of the woods, you cross the driveway and back into the woods on the opposite side. Here is where the course gently starts an incline. When you emerge from the woodlands, you turn left back onto the driveway, and up back over the canal bridge, this time stay left to follow the woodland path back up the hill. This path then crosses the driveway, where you go back along the path you took out for the first 1k, however, as you get to the top, you take a slight right, then left, to finish on a straight. The course is challenging, fun and rewarding, set in beautiful surroundings with lots to see en route.",

You are now approaching Hairpin Hill again whereby you ascend taking a 180 at the fork back up the hill to the junction. At HPH this time turn right, keeping to the left at the bottom of the course whilst you do an anti&#45;clockwise loop of the big playing fields. Keep straight ahead to RJ, then left and left again at HPH to repeat the big loop. When you return back to HPH go right back down the hill following the route you started with, going clockwise around the running track to the finish at the end of the opposite straight.",

Runners then turn right onto a 300 metre grass stretch, before turning left at the 1km mark. The next 1km is a loop of a large field adjacent to Evergreen Wood. Just after the 2km mark, runners turn left onto a wide dirt track. After a long gentle descent through Garden Wood and past the half way mark, runners turn right through a gate (attended by a marshal) and pass the 3km point just before reaching the Riverside Cottage. The course crosses the River Mimram, with runners veering left just after the crossing onto a grass section that loops around Kings Lake before entering another field at 4km. At the end of the field, a sharp left then right turn takes runners over two small wooden bridges and onto a dirt trail between a field and the A414.

Follow this until you reach a marshal at which point you head down a slope taking the lower path back in the opposite direction, follow this back to the end of the concrete path but this time immediately turn left down a grassy path which heads towards the main river. Follow this path until you see a marshal which will take you up the slope turning right back onto the sea wall with the river on your left. This leads all the way back to the starting car park where you will see the finish funnel.",

The run starts and finishes just North of car park 4 (the furthest car park from the Watersports Centre). From the start you have a long straight run on the West bank of the loch for approximately 1.5 km. At the top of the loch you proceed into a wooded area for 250m, at this point it is important for the runners to keep left. On emerging from the wooded area, the runners take a left fork and follow the path that is furthest from the loch. The path will continue for a further 0.75 km at which point you reach the turn. The turn sweeps round and brings you onto a path adjacent to the loch and continues for 0.75 km until you return to the wooded area. Again it is important to keep left. Once out the wooded area you have a straight run back towards the North Lanarkshire tower and the finish.",
